			<h5>Summary</h5>
              <p class="p1">
              Inspection is a 3rd person puzzle platformer, I made during my first year at university. The aim of this project was to design and develop a prototype level, that illustrates a good understanding of Blueprint Scripting and uses this university provided framework.  
              </p>
			  <p>
			  Since submitting this project there are numerous changes, I would apply to improve the design and development quality. Which I am aware of and have used going forward with my work. These changes include:
			  </p>
			  <br>
			  <p>
			  -	Ease players into all relevant controls. Until after submission I did not realize new players would be unaware of some control inputs required to make progress. As players do not hold the same knowledge as me the designer. Leaving players confused because they would be unaware of the required control inputs needed to progress through gameplay activities. Therefore, to resolve this issue I have learnt to ensure controls are visualised when appropriate (e.g., UI system). 
			  </p>
			  <br>
			  <p>
			  -	Establish a main objective. According to testing feedback from colleagues, this level lacked a cohesive objective that compelled players to move forward. I have learnt having an objective is important because it can immediately establish player immersion, into the world and gameplay systems I have created.

			<h5>Summary</h5>
              <p class="p1">
              Labyrinth is a top-down platform adventure, I made during my first year at university.  The purpose of this project was to design and develop a prototype level which displays various uses of Blueprint Scripting and utilised the university provided framework.  
              </p>
			  <p>
			  Following from submission, with my current knowledge of game design, there are some changes I would apply to this project. Which would of improved the quality such as: 
			  </p>
			  <br>
			  <p>
			  -	Adding more visual flare to improve polish. During development, my focus was ensuring all mechanics were functioning and fun to interact with. After submission I recognise the look of Labyrinth does not quite synergise with the quality fun feel the gameplay mechanics provide. Therefore, to alleviate this design issue, I would increase the environmental detail. By adding in non-interactable assets that fill the space and match the setting like pipes and wires.
			  </p>
			  <br>
			  <p>
			  -	Decrease player downtime to improve level pacing. From observing colleagues testing my level, I noticed some players wanted to quickly resume the game after meeting their demise. As once players fall into lava or acid, it would take a while for their health to completely deplete. Which now I can see bloats pacing of the level. Therefore, reducing the lava and acid damage timer would create a far more engaging experience for the player.
